<p> I completed my PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of <a href="http://martyweissman.com/">Martin Weissman</a> and I'm a Mathematics Lecturer at UC Santa Cruz. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz, I received a M.S. in Mathematics from University of South Florida, a M.S. in Cryptograpy and a B.S. in Math and Computer Science from University of Bucharest.
